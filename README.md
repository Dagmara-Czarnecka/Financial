# Financial
In this project, I used the Financial database, which contains information about loans that have been repaid or not.
It is worth noting that the database is based on real data that has been anonymized in order to make it public. It is a collection of financial information from a certain Czech bank. The dataset includes data for over 5,300 customers with approximately one million transactions. What's more, the bank also provided data for nearly 700 loans granted and about 900 credit cards issued
